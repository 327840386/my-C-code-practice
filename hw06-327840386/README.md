# HW 6 Mergesort

This is the README for HW06. You do not need to submit this README or the code in this repository anywhere; instead, you will submit a recording to the Canvas assignment only. This repository is just here to give you a good, clean starter file for your live coding. 

## Important notes

* You must code this assignment live during the recording: the starter file must be identical to this mergesort.c file when you start; it must not have any additional code or comments in it. You must write the code while being recorded, and you should explain your code line-by-line as you code it, just as you would in (for example) a live coding interview. 
* See the Canvas assignment for additional instructions.
